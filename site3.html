        Tiburcio Vasquez (April 11, 1835 – March 19, 1875) was a Californio
        bandido who was active in California from 1854 to 1874. The Vasquez
        Rocks, 40 miles (64 km) north of Los Angeles, were one of his many
        hideouts and are named after him. Vasquez was popular in the
        Mexican-American community, and had many friends and family members from
        Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south. He was
        handsome, literate, charming, played guitar, and was a skillful dancer.
        Women were attracted to him and he had many love affairs. He enjoyed
        reading romantic novels and writing poetry for his female admirers. He
        had several affairs with married women, one of which eventually led to
        his downfall. Even today, Tiburcio Vásquez remains controversial. He is
        seen as a hero by some for his defiance of what he viewed as unjust laws
        and discrimination. Others regard him as a colorful outlaw. To this day,
        many continue to visit and pay respects to Vasquez's grave. He was
        buried in Santa Clara Mission Cemetery in Santa Clara, California. His
        grave is very difficult to find, but visitors to Santa Clara cemetery
        have managed to find it for years. The groundskeeper directed Vasquez
        relative Patrick McAnaney to the grave in 1980, telling him "Vasquez
        lived at odds with the people, and he was buried at odds with
        them."[citation needed] This was in reference to his gravestone being
        set at an angle relative to the other gravestones.
        <br />
        <br />

        Online photos show his grave beside two large cacti and in front of a
        palm tree, no longer standing. His carved granite headstone is the only
        stone in the entire cemetery to stand at an angle. All the rest are in
        uniform rows, and many other graves surrounding Vasquez's grave are flat
        to the ground as if no one else wanted to be interred near the famous
        bandido until decades later when his notoriety had died down.[citation
        needed] Vasquez's ghost is said to haunt many places, including the
        cemetery, some of his hideouts, areas where gruesome crimes were
        committed, and the prison cells where he was held
