    <h1>Project 1 Alpha</h1>

    <p></p>

    <p>
      Here is a test of a photoscan object using the 3D Model viewer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Concept I would like to explore is highlight the history and stories of my
      local cementary that I visit to often. The Santa Clara Mission Cemetery.
      I've done a few projects in the past with this locale as the subject; now
      with my expoloration of 3D scanning I would like to experiment with some
      archiving of significant historical objects and sites.
      <br />
      <br />
      Below is a 3D Scan to showcase how I would represent this objects with the
      photoscanning technique. I combination with
      <a
        href="https://santaclaramissioncemetery.org/about-us#:~:text=history,Clara%20changed%20locations%204%20times."
        >this site
      </a>
      and further research, I hope to learn the untold histories and mysterious
      of this cementery and bring it to light in another dimension and
      perspective.
